C3D-LSTM is used in the following papers:

1. [Learning to Score Olympic Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05125)

2. [Action Quality Assessment Across Multiple Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06367)


Originally I had implemented [C3D-LSTM](https://github.com/ParitoshParmar/LTSOE) in Caffe. I haven't tested this PyTorch version for exact results, but it should give results close to original implementation.
